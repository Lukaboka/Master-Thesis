## Abstract

Open world video games face the challenge of striking the balance between guidance and player freedom, as to provide enough guidance for the player towards objectives while keeping the game non-linear to preserve player autonomy. In order to achieve this, subtle guidance through level design choices such as environmental shape or topology can be utilized for that purpose. However, current development lacks tools and guidelines to assess whether an open world game is suitable to achieve the balance between player guidance and autonomy to deliver the intended game experience. This paper examines Nintendoâ€™s \textit{The Legend of
Zelda: Breath of the Wild} design philosophies as a case study in order to infer tools and guidelines for general open world level design. It's design philosophies and level design strategies prove to be useful to purposefully lead the player's attention through the game world by subtle means without actively disrupting player freedom. Finally, this paper proposes a tool developed for Unity that assists level design decision-making by indicating visibility information of objects in the game scene during the design process incorporating a key aspect of Nintendo's design strategy into the general level design workflow for open world games.
